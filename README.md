# LeetCode Notes

This repository contains my personal solutions to selected LeetCode problems. Each solution includes a Python implementation and a short explanation written in Markdown.

The goal is to be familiar with key algorithmic patterns and keep a clean record of problems I’ve practiced.

## About

I use this repo as a study log and review tool for Leetcode questions.  
The solutions are written in Python and follow a simple format.  
This is mostly for my own reference, but feel free to look around.
